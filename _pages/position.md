### For Prospective PhD Students
I am looking for PhD students who are passionate about research (machine leanring and data mining), strong in independent thinking and communication, has good programming and math background. If you mention me in your program application, please also drop me an email so that I will not miss your application. Please read the following guideline to better demonstrate your purpose and strengths.

* Send your application to Lu Lin (`lxl5598[at]psu[dot]edu`)
* Mail subject line as *[Prospective Student - PhD] Your Name*
* Briefly mention your education background, GPA/Rank, English test scores (especially speaking) if available
* Briefly introduce your research experience, and it will make you stand out if you have publications at top-tier venues (e.g., ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, KDD, WWW, AAAI etc)
* If you do not have any paper experience (which is normal), a very effective way to impress me is to contact me early and work with me (see **For Interns**)
* Attach your CV, transcript, and English test scores if available

Multiple fully-funded PhD positions are available. Please mention my name in the application system when you apply to the graduate program at College of Information Science and Technology at Penn State University. The start dates of the positions are flexible, i.e., Spring or Fall semesters.

### For Interns

I also welcome interns who have machine learning background and aim for research publications.
