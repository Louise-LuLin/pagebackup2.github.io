:wave: **Bio**: Hi, I'm Lu. I am currently a tenure-track assistant professor in the College of Information Sciences and Technology, Penn State University starting 2022 Fall. Prior to that, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at University of Virginia in 2022, under supervision of Dr. Hongning Wang. I recieved my M.s. and B.S. in 2017 and 2014 respectively, from Computer Science at Beihang University. I have also interned at Didi Lab, LinkedIn and Pinterest Lab.

:pushpin: **Research interests**: I have a broad interest in machine learning and data mining. My current focus is practical and trustworthy machine learning, especially on graph-structured data, concerning multiple aspects including robustness, fairness, interpretability and privacy. To be more specific:
- `machine learning on graphs`, e.g. graph neural networks, graph representation learning
- `trustworthy machine learning`, w.r.t. adversarial robustness, fairness, interpretability, privacy
- `data mining and data science` in real-world applications
