  abstract  = {Retrosynthetic planning aims to devise a complete multi-step synthetic route from starting materials to a target molecule. Current strategies use a decoupled approach of single-step retrosynthesis models and search algorithms, taking only the product as the input to predict the reactants for each planning step and ignoring valuable context information along the synthetic route. In this work, we propose a novel framework that utilizes context information for improved retrosynthetic planning. We view synthetic routes as reaction graphs and propose to incorporate context through three principled steps: encode molecules into embeddings, aggregate information over routes, and readout to predict reactants. Our approach is the first attempt to utilize in-context learning for retrosynthesis prediction in retrosynthetic planning. The entire framework can be efficiently optimized in an end-to-end fashion and produce more practical and accurate predictions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that by fusing in the context information over routes, our model significantly improves the performance of retrosynthetic planning over baselines that are not context-aware, especially for long synthetic routes.

Despite the wide application of GCL techniques, little attention has been paid to the security of GCL. In this paper, we systematically study the vulnerability of GCL in the presence of malicious backdoor adversaries. In particular, we propose *GCBA*, the first backdoor attack for graph contrastive learning. GCBA incorporates three attacks: poisoning, crafting, and natural backdoor, each targeting one stage of the GCL pipeline. We formulate our attacks as optimization problems and solve them with a novel discrete optimization technique to overcome the discrete nature of graph-structured data. By extensively evaluating GCBA on multiple datasets and GCL methods, we show that our attack can achieve high attack success rates while preserving stealthiness. We further consider potential countermeasures to our attack and conclude that existing defenses are insufficient to mitigate GCBA. We show that as a complex paradigm involving data and model republishing, GCL is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, and specifically designed defenses are needed to mitigate the backdoor attacks on GCL.},

Its performance heavily relies on graph augmentation to reflect invariant patterns that are robust to small perturbations; yet it still remains unclear about what graph invariance GCL should capture. Recent studies mainly perform topology augmentations in a uniformly random manner in the spatial domain, ignoring its influence on the intrinsic structural properties embedded in the spectral domain. In this work, we aim to find a principled way for topology augmentations by exploring the invariance of graphs from the spectral perspective. We develop spectral augmentation which guides topology augmentations by maximizing the spectral change. Extensive experiments on both graph and node classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in self-supervised representation learning. The proposed method also brings promising generalization capability in transfer learning, and is equipped with intriguing robustness property under adversarial attacks. Our study sheds light on a general principle for graph topology augmentation.},

We define the spectral distance based on the eigenvalues of graph Laplacian to measure the disruption of spectral filters. We then generate edge perturbations by simultaneously maximizing a task-specific attack objective and the proposed spectral distance. The experiments demonstrate remarkable effectiveness of the proposed attack in the white-box setting at both training and test time. Our qualitative analysis shows the connection between the attack behavior and the imposed changes on the spectral distribution, which provides empirical evidence that maximizing spectral distance is an effective manner to change the structural property of graphs in the spatial domain and perturb the frequency components in the Fourier domain.},

  abstract  = {Graph embedding techniques are pivotal in real-world machine learning tasks that operate on graph-structured data, such as social recommendation and protein structure modeling. Embeddings are mostly performed on the node level for learning representations of each node. Since the formation of a graph is inevitably affected by certain sensitive node attributes, the node embeddings can inherit such sensitive information and introduce undesirable biases in downstream tasks. Most existing works impose ad-hoc constraints on the node embeddings to restrict their distributions for unbiasedness/fairness, which however compromise the utility of the resulting embeddings. In this paper, we propose a principled new way for unbiased graph embedding by learning node embeddings from an underlying bias-free graph, which is not influenced by sensitive node attributes. Motivated by this new perspective, we propose two complementary methods for uncovering such an underlying graph, with the goal of introducing minimum impact on the utility of the embeddings. Both our theoretical justification and extensive experimental comparisons against state-of-the-art solutions demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. },

When modeling the neighborhood structure for graph representation learning, most prior works ignore such latent groups and nodes' membership to different groups, not to mention the hierarchy. Thus, they fall short of delivering a comprehensive understanding of the nodes under different contexts in a graph. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical attentive membership model for graph embedding, where the latent memberships for each node are dynamically discovered based on its neighboring context. Both group-level and individual-level attentions are performed when aggregating neighboring states to generate node embeddings. We introduce structural constraints to explicitly regularize the inferred memberships of each node, such that a well-defined hierarchical grouping structure is captured. The proposed model outperformed a set of state-of-the-art graph embedding solutions on node classification and link prediction tasks in a variety of graphs including citation networks and social networks. Qualitative evaluations visualize the learned node embeddings along with the inferred memberships, which proved the concept of membership hierarchy and enables explainable embedding learning in graphs.},

Edge text content is encoded as low-dimensional mixtures of latent topics, which serve as semantic channels for topic-level information passing on edges. We embed nodes and topics in the same latent space to capture their mutual dependency when decoding the structural and textual information on graph.

However, this process is costly as it usually requires domain expertise with a deep understanding of the building system and its point naming scheme. In this study, we aim to reduce the human effort required for mapping sensors to their context, i.e., metadata mapping. We formulate the problem as a sequential labeling process and use the conditional random field to exploit the regular and dependent structures observed in the metadata. We develop a suite of active learning strategies to adaptively select the most informative subsequences in point names for human labeling, which significantly reduces the inputs from domain experts.

Motivated by the Item Response Theory (IRT), we model each review document as a user's detailed response to an item, and assume the response is jointly determined by the individuality of the user and the property of the item. We model the text-based response with a generative topic model, in which we characterize the items' properties and users' manifestations of them in a low-dimensional topic space. Via posterior inference, we separate and study these two components over a collection of review documents. Extensive experiments on two large collections of Amazon and Yelp review data verified the effectiveness of the proposed solution: it outperforms the state-of-art topic models with better predictive power in unseen documents, which is directly translated into improved performance in item recommendation and item summarization tasks.},

Existing works are mainly based on raw speed sensing data obtained from infrastructure sensors or probe vehicles, which, however, are limited by expensive cost of sensor deployment and maintenance. With sparse speed observations, traditional methods based only on speed sensing data are insufficient, especially when emergencies like traffic accidents occur. To address the issue, this paper aims to improve the road traffic speed prediction by fusing traditional speed sensing data with new-type “sensing” data from cross domain sources, such as tweet sensors from social media and trajectory sensors from map and traffic service platforms. Jointly modeling information from different datasets brings many challenges, including location uncertainty of low-resolution data, language ambiguity of traffic description in texts, and heterogeneity of cross-domain data. In response to these challenges, we present a unified probabilistic framework, called Topic-Enhanced Gaussian Process Aggregation Model (TEGPAM), consisting of three components, i.e., location disaggregation model, traffic topic model, and traffic speed Gaussian Process model, which integrate new-type data with traditional data. Experiments on real world data from two large cities validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our model.},
